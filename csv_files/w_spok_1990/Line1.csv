And thirdly , make it a private contract   no coin flipping after you 're dead   make a private one with a family member , a family member , a close friend , a veterinarian . It may or may not involve a trust , but make the arrangements in advance . Try to do it privately with as little to do with lawyers on it as possible  .WALTERS Suppose you are older and you want to have a                     older or when you 're very young , what do you do if the pet 's very young .

But I                     researchers say is the most common form of sleepwalking , just sitting up or talking or screaming . It 's most prevalent in children . This kind of screaming is called   night terrors .   It 's awful for the parents who , naturally , believe their child 's going through something horrible and damaging . But the experts say just let the child go through it . Do n't try to wake her . They claim this will have no permanent effect on the child . ""]"

No one suggested a sleep clinic . For years , people have tried to control sleepwalkers by tying them up or , as in this case , putting barbed wire around the bed . An inventor in Maine actually patented this technique . They thought such steps were necessary because they assumed sleepwalkers were possessed or insane . Now , doctors say ,   It 's not really a psychological problem . It 's a physical disorder and we can treat it . on camera Now , there                     sleep .

This is unusual because when most of us dream , our brain sends out a mysterious signal that paralyzes our muscles .
