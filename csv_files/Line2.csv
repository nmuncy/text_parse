43-Dr ROSEFIELD ,"[115, "" It 's definitely a prison , but we do n't want it to look like a prison and that 's not necessary for the older inmate . There 's nothing to be gained by having a very rigid , formal , authoritarian approach and the people do n't need it . You can have a far kinder approach to them and still get the job done . We are responsible first to the public to keep them here , but after that , there are a lot of things you can           some McCain inmates actually get a glimpse of the outside world , a field trip .

But using other prisoners to contribute to medical care wo n't do much to stem the rising costs . The expense of caring for the aging prison population will become staggering in the next century . But shocking as it may seem , prison can sometimes appear to be the best health care option for an old person who is alone and ca n't work or afford basic necessities . That 's           , he has served the longest prison sentence of any inmate in North Carolina . He entered prison in 1952 and has had no contact with anyone on the outside since then .

It costs three times more to support an older inmate than a younger one , simply because of medical care . And that puts a big strain on the prison system and the taxpayer . For instance , when 69-year-old convicted murderer Howard King contracted gangrene , doctors at McCain tried to save his remaining leg , but were forced to amputate it . The cost of those procedures alone totaled almost $21,000 . Medical care is so expensive for some elderly people that a prison term seems a small price to pay           had an old gentleman from the mountains who came to prison to get a cataract removed from his eye . And the very year , he threw a brick through a department store window so that he could come back and get the other eye operated on .

48-Dr ROSEFIELD ,"[68, "" The prison systems need to have a nursing home-type facility . They ca n't just have a prison unit for old people . They 've got to have the medical care backup .
